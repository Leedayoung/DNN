Main purpose of this 
This program consist by three part Utility,core and application. 
Core is core part of the library. Core support function or APIs of nearest neighbor.
Core part is written by c++. Utility consist by used utilities for constructing core part.
For example, quadtree is uesd for core part and it can be used for many other apllication 
In this case, quadtree apears on utillity part.
Application is consist by some algorithms and apllications. 
It coded by ant languges.
